<h4>MetaData entry</h4>
    <p> 
        This week was really difficult to come into the area to scan. I thought I would be able to manage, but I ended up entering metadata on my own time. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be that tedious, but I found the work to be really monotonous. Looking at how we title things its "title_date_volume_section" but I think date should come before to make it more clear. I was also a bit confused going through some of the files because the volume would be at 55, but looking at the actual paper I would see volume 4. I really need to clarify that section to continue doing metadata. Another thing I saw was the comment section. I thought it would be nice to write some comments about the article itself. Man I really would love to have the image with the metadata attached to it.

<h4>Website research</h4>
    <p> 
       This week I managed to do some research on what would be a good place to store data for free that can hold images as well. I found that it probably would be better to get two separate databases, one for metadata and the other for photos. Now the question of putting in the images to the database seems really tedious especially because all the images (jpg) that would go in there are located on teams and not a collective folder. I might start a mock site just to see how much it could possibly scale.
