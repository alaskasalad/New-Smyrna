<h4>Overview and Concerns</h4>
    <p>
        After 2 long weeks, the titan scanner is working! I was able to join everyone Thursday afternoon to learn how to scan the documents using the software on the computer. A lot of the software is just knowing what button does what and setting up the pages correctly. It was way less complicated than what I thougth was going to happen. I noticed there were some ads that were just exactly the same as the last sections side and it was really confusing. At one point I had thought I started to scan in the opposite way I was supposed to. Dylan was able to help me get in on track. Another time I had accidentally took a picture when I didn't want to so I had to delete it and then change the page number back to its proper place. Sometimes it gets really repetivie so it's easy to make small mistakes as you keep going. 
        I'll go ahead and list out the steps here just for reference in the future.

<h4>The Metadata</h4>
    <p>
        1. set up a new session and name the file correctly </br>
        2. set the page counter to be 2 and start the page number where it was left off at. </br>
        3. get the live footage going and use the "AF" button to auto focus </br>
        4. take pictures of the book. Doing small sections </br>
        5. crop the scans 
        6. select all, and export as a .tiff file to the folder you're working on, then go back and do the same for .jpg for windows view </br>
        7. remove the hard drive from the pc, and plug it into the other computer </br>
        8. log into teams and upload the files in the folder (thinking about why can't we just stay on the same pc and do this there...)

<h4>Next Week</h4>
    <p>
        This upcoming week, I'm hoping to get more metadata done than anything. I know I'm going to be very busy, but I still need to work on this project for the team. This week, I've sort of been in a bad funk and it was really hard for me to leave my room even though it's a mess right now. I wish I could've looking more into starting the database for this project so there can be a dedicated site. I would love to be able to get a photo in the site, writing out the data when you're logged in, and then adding tags to the scans. The tagging system I think would add a lot of easy look ups for multiple of the same category. When I have time this weekend, I'll start working on it (hopefully!)
