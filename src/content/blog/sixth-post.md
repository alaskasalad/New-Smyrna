<h4>Website research</h4>
    <p>
        A lot of my time this week went into studying for my physics 2 midterm, however I was able to get some metadata recorded. Having the files there are really nice, having the searching time cut in half, but now I have no idea which photo we left off at. I think I just need to clarify how the title of the photo relates to the informaiton put into the metadata which is on me of course.

        This week I mostly worked on the design by looking at other museums and how they would go about displaying this information. I really enjoyed how the <a href="https://stonetoolsmuseum.com/about/">museum of stone tools</a> layed out their site, but since this newspaper is only loctaed in Florida obviously, I ended up moving away from the idea. From here I went to the 
        <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?department=African+Art+in+The+Michael+C.+Rockefeller+Wing&offset=0">Met's website</a> to see how their art is layed out. I was a big fan of this because they were in collections with tags to pick from to sort out the artifacts. I think having tags for users to pick from such as year or specific day (such as January 1st) would be very helpful in the long run. Even the <a href="https://nsbhistory.org/">New Smyrna Museum of History's own website</a> is pretty nice with the layout, so this project would have to be added in one of the drop downs for people to explore. This dropdown of the <a href="https://nsbhistory.org/the-turnbull-settlement-smyrnea/">Turnbull Settlement Booklet</a> is the most like what we are doing and the site is built using wordpress. I would love to build something new for the museum, but most likely the sections of the book would be separated then the user can click on which booklet they would like to go through and this would be done with the current setup.
