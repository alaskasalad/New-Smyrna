<h4>Overview and Concerns</h4>
    <p>
        This week, the previous interns and the new ones had met up on Thursday to give an overview of what will be happening. I’m very glad I was finally able to see them in person for the first time and sort of memorize names. I am a bit concerned about the door access since my ucf id does not work with it yet as well as getting into the CHDR reservation site. So when I tried logging into the CHDR site, it said I already have an account, but I do not. I sent a password reset around 3pm only for the system to send me the email at 6pm. Upon resetting… it said the link had expired. We were going to have to use one user and password for the system instead of our own, but after a call with the company it's functioning like normal again.

<h4>The Metadata</h4>
    <p>
        During this meeting with everyone, I was able to get access to teams where I would see the excel sheet used for recording data. Jack came up with a really good idea of starting a new sheet so this semester’s data can be easily found rather than scrolling through thousands of excel rows. The previous interns expressed that they were a bit disappointed that transcribing the data didn’t really happen; they were more concerned with scanning everything in. One part of the meta data is going through teams to find the jpeg images, then transcribing them to excel. I brought up if there was a possibility of moving the data to a database online, and Dylan was very excited if it could be done. This would definitely help me out, I like creating websites but for it to serve an actual purpose. I will have to look into getting it all set up and figure out the permissions so not everyone who logs in will be able to add data. This will come with time, but I’m very excited to explore that aspect during the internship.

<h4>Ending notes</h4>
    <p>
        Everyone was so nice, and I enjoyed all of the conversions I was able to have. This project is definitely right up my alley, so I’m glad I did take the chance to apply.
